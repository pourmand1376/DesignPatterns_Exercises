`Strategy` method is very similar to `State` method. Their implementation is also quite the same ([+](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1658192/what-is-the-difference-between-strategy-design-pattern-and-state-design-pattern)). 

They are different conceptually. Strategy is about having different algorithms which can replace each other. 

State is when you can have a state machine that each state does very different things. 

> The State pattern deals with what (state or type) an object is (in) -- it encapsulates state-dependent behavior, whereas

> the Strategy pattern deals with how an object performs a certain task -- it encapsulates an algorithm.

This example is also useful ([+](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16058371/4201765)).
